# **CardWorkoutGame**

CardWorkoutGame is a simple game that uses playing cards to generate workout routines. The app displays a deck of cards shuffling in the middle of the screen. Every 0.15 seconds, a new card is dealt. The user must then perform the exercise associated with the card. There are three buttons on the screen:

* Stop: This button stops the deck from shuffling and deals you the card.
* Restart: This button restarts the game, starting the shuffling again.
* Rules: This button shows the rules of the game, which explain which exercise is associated with each card.
